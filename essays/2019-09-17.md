When I first got started I din't really know where to begin.  I started with the screencast because I needed a jump off point. Once I got started, all of the readings really started to come in to play.  the html begginners guide really helped me when deciding on format.  The step by step help in the screen cast really helps and I liked that there was many opportunities to practice.
I would recomend re-reading all of the material then trying to tackle the task on your own first.  If that doesnt help you get started, I would then start the screencast.  The material gets easier the more that you practice.
