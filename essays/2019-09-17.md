When I first got started I din't really know where to begin.  I started with the screencast because I needed a jump off point. Once I got started, all of the readings really started to come in to play.  the html begginners guide really helped me when deciding on format.  The step by step help in the screen cast really helps and I liked that there was many opportunities to practice.
