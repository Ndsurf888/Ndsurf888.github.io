I decided to get my double major in MIS and Finance because I believe that automation is going to affect many jobs in the future, and I thought it was a good idea to be involved with the technological boom.  I love technology and learning my way through new devices.  I was interested in majoring in computer science in the beginning of my college journey but decided that I like business more and realized the MIS just might be a perfect fit.  I love that we have an opportunity to learn how to code and the very fundamentals that will allow us to build off what we will learn in MIS.
