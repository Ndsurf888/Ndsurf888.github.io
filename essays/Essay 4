My programming skills have greatly improved.
I am enthusiastic about programming:  I am entusiastic about programming.  It is a lot of fun and I believe it will only take more practice.
I can do the practice WODs without looking at the screencast solutions.  I have a tought time doing the wods without looking at the screen cast.
I just need to practice more and more.
The labs have helped me to learn and I am able to complete them with confidence.  The labs have not helped out very much as i am not too sure what is
goig on in class because the pace is really fast.
I feel ready to move to the next stage of complexity in programming (building small web applications).  I will be able to get through it but will be difficult.
I think the class can be improved to help my learning.  This class has definately helped my programming skills.
There are things that work really well my learning in this class. The explanations are helpful.
This assignment was very interesting.  I was able to get the structure of the website but the harder part was setting up the server.
I started using a html to desing the basic strutcutre and I got a little confused about where to place all of the functions.  Also another
thing that helped out a lot was the labs.  the labs allowed me to review what I was doing and to make sure that I did it correctly.  After all
the exercise was very beneficial.
