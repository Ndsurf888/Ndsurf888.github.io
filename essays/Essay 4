This assignment was very interesting.  I was able to get the structure of the website but the harder part was setting up the server.
I started using a html to desing the basic strutcutre and I got a little confused about where to place all of the functions.  Also another
thing that helped out a lot was the labs.  the labs allowed me to review what I was doing and to make sure that I did it correctly.  After all
the exercise was very beneficial.
